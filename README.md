Accessing the project is extremely simple and the process to do so will be described below

The only mandatory dependency that must be installed before you can run the project is Unity this is required if you wish to open the project. It is also highly recommended that you use an IDE of some kind to access the scripts. I used visual studio, but others are available if you so desire.

To open the project in Unity extract the zip file into a folder then open Unity. Click on add project and navigate to the file that you extracted the zip file. Then open the added project, this might take a while. When the project opens you will arrive at a blank screen find the assets folder and go to scenes open any of the scenes to see the game.
